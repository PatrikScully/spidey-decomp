// Phase 2 bootstrap: the exe's data segment at its original address.
//
// 835 globals in the repo are still bound to SpideyPC.exe addresses (G_*
// macros and "static T* const x = (T*)0x...;"). Instead of giving every one
// of them storage up front, the standalone build maps the exe's .rdata/.data
// range (0x53B000..0x2E0C000, 42 MB, nearly all of it zero bss) at that
// fixed address and seeds the initialized part from the user's own
// SpideyPC.exe. All existing address macros then work unchanged, and there
// is one copy of every global, so the Phase 1 split-brain problem does not
// exist here. Phase 2b retires this file by moving globals to real storage.
//
// Never maps .text: no exe code is ever executed by the standalone build.
